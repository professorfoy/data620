#### Final Project

Policy on Collaboration

You may work in a team of up to three people. Each project team member is responsible for understanding and being able 
to explain all of the submitted project code. Remember that you can take work that you find elsewhere as a base to 
build on, but you need to acknowledge the source, so that I base your grade on what you contributed, not on what you 
started with! 

Final Project Proposal

Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this 
analysis. A guiding question or hypothesis to test is one good way to start. If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), 
you should also list your partners’ names.

You should briefly describe your data sources; plan for doing the work, and up front concerns. If you are working in a group, 
please describe the roles and responsibilities of each group member.

We’ll treat this proposal as a planning document, not a blue print containing “firm, fixed requirements.” 

Final Project

Your project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. 
You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an 
R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters.

Final Project Presentation

We’ll schedule a short presentation for each team, either in our last scheduled meet-up or in additional office hours to be 
scheduled during the last week of classes.

Your final project is due on Friday
