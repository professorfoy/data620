PDF version: Facebook’s Restrictions on User Data Cast a Long Shadow - WSJ 
A considerable amount of the material on APIs in our course text Mining the Social Web, 2/e (October 2013) 
has been either removed or deprecated. New sources of APIs are also constantly emerging. 

Give an example of where access to web-based data has changed (increased or decreased) over time, whether due to changes 
in corporate objectives or in the regulatory environment.  Who was impacted (positively or negatively) by these changes?  
What implications if any are there from the standpoint of being able to use this data in downstream analysis and/or product development?
