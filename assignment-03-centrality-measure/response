Assignment Three: Centrality Measures
Requirement:
Centrality measures can be used to predict (positive or negative) outcomes for a node.
Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)
In addition to identifying your data source, you should create a high level plan that describes how you would load the data for analysis, and describe a hypothetical outcome that could be predicted from comparing degree centrality across categorical groups. 
For this week’s assignment, you are not required to actually load or analyze the data.  Please see also Project 1 below.
You may work in a small group on the assignment.   You should post your document to GitHub by end of day on Sunday.

Response:
For this assignment, I will analyze how nonprofit organizations in New York City are connected through shared board members and whether Health Organization classified nonprofits occupy more influential positions within that governance structure. Using publicly available IRS data, I will construct a board interlock network of nearly 27,000 NYC nonprofits. In this network, two organizations are connected if they share at least one board member. These shared leadership relationships form a governance structure that reflects how influence, information, and strategic coordination may circulate across organizations. In this network, each node will represent a nonprofit organization, and an edge will exist between two nonprofits if they share at least one board member. Intuitively, it would seem plausible that doctors and other highly influential people would serve on multiple Boards in the health nonprofit organization ecosystem. 

A key strength of the IRS dataset is that each nonprofit includes a categorical variable based on IRS National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE codes). I will group organizations into two categories: Health and Non-Health. This classification will allow me to compare degree and eigenvector centrality measures across meaningful sector groups.

My high-level plan will begin by loading the IRS metadata and board member datasets, cleaning and standardizing EIN identifiers, and filtering to nonprofits located in New York City. Acquiring the IRS dataset is a complex process which will involve directly downloading datasets containing over 700,000 tax returns (no API available) and converting them to Parquet files for faster processing. I will then merge NTEE codes to classify organizations as Health or Non-Health. Next, I will construct the board interlock network by generating connections between nonprofits that share board members. After isolating the largest connected component, I will calculate degree centrality and eigenvector centrality for each organization. Finally, I will compare the average centrality scores of Health and Non-Health nonprofits using statistical tests and visualizations.

The primary hypothetical outcome I will test is whether Health-related nonprofits exert higher structural influence than other nonprofits. My reasoning is that health organizations often operate in complex, resource-intensive environments and frequently interact with hospitals, foundations, insurers, and government agencies. Because of these layered relationships, I would expect Health nonprofits to maintain more board interlocks, resulting in higher degree centrality and potentially higher eigenvector centrality compared to Nonhealth nonprofit sectors. If Health nonprofits exhibit significantly higher average degree centrality, I would interpret this as evidence that they are more embedded in governance networks and potentially exert greater influence within the broader nonprofit ecosystem.

Overall, this dataset will provide a strong foundation for testing whether sector classification predicts structural influence. By comparing centrality measures across categories, I will be able to evaluate whether Health nonprofits occupy more influential positions within the governance network.
