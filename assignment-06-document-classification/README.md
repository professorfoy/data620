#### Assignment 06 - Document Classification

It can be useful to be able to classify new "test" documents using already classified "training" documents.  
A common example is using a corpus of labeled spam and ham (non-spam) e-mails to predict whether or not a new document is spam.  
Here is one example of such data:  UCI Machine Learning Repository: Spambase Data Set

For this project, you can either use the above dataset to predict the class of new documents (either withheld from the training 
dataset or from another source such as your own spam folder).

For more adventurous students, you are welcome (encouraged!) to come up a different set of documents (including scraped web pages!?) 
that have already been classified (e.g. tagged), then analyze these documents to predict how new documents should be classified.
