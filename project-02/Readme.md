#### Project 2 

Identify a large 2-node network dataset—you can start with a dataset in a repository.  
Your data should meet the criteria that it consists of ties between and not within two (or more) distinct groups.
Reduce the size of the network using a method such as the island method described in chapter 4 of social network analysis.
What can you infer about each of the distinct groups?
You may work in a small group on the project.

Your code and analysis should be delivered in an IPython Notebook by end of day Monday
